    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soft vanilla cake, rolled up to a delicious and light <br>
        whipped cream and strawberry jam and walnuts.<br>
        Decorated with powdered sugar and cookies.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Flour</li>
       <li>Vegetable oil</li>
       <li>Milk</li>
       <li>Vanilla extract</li>
       <li>Sugar</li>
       <li>Eggs</li>
       <li>Baking powder</li>
       <li>Salt</li>
       <li>Strawberry jam</li>
       <li>Whipped cream</li>
       <li>Powdered sugar</li>
       <li>Cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks. Mix 3/4 of the sugar with the egg whites to create a french meringue.</li>
        <li>Whip up the egg yolks with the rest of the sugar until you get to the ribbon stage. Mix up the oil, milk and vanilla extract in it. </li>
        <li>Add 1/3 of the whipped egg whites to the mix of egg yolk until fully incorporated. Then add it back to the egg whites, folding it without losing the bubbles.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, sift in the flour and baking powder, then add it to the other mixture in the same folding motion, very carefully until incorporated.</li>
        <li>On a large baking tray, lined with parchment paper and sprayed with vegetable oil, add the batter and bake at 325 F for 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the cake is ready, take out the oven and place on a tea towel with powdered sugar on it, then roll it and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, put some of the whipped cream inside along with the strawberry jam, roll it back up and decorate with more whipping cream and cookies.</li>
    </ol>
